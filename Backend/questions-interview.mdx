# **Backend Developer Interview Topics – Detailed Roadmap (Updated for 2025)**

This expanded roadmap builds on the original by providing more in-depth explanations, examples, and sample interview questions for each subtopic. I've incorporated advanced topics based on 2025 trends, such as cloud-native development, AI integration, distributed systems resilience, and performance in high-scale environments. These additions reflect evolving demands like microservices, serverless architectures, and AI/ML backend integration. Prepare by practicing coding problems (e.g., LeetCode) and system design scenarios.
