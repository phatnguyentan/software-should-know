# Object-Oriented Programming principles

Here are some common interview questions and answers about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: [1]

Q: What are the four main principles of OOP? A: The four main principles are:

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), controlling access through access modifiers

Inheritance: Mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class

Polymorphism: Ability of objects to take multiple forms and behave differently based on context

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only necessary features

Q: Explain encapsulation with an example A: Here's a practical example:

public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;  // private data member
    private String accountNumber;

    // Public methods to access private data
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
}

Q: What's the difference between method overloading and overriding? A:

Method Overloading (Compile-time polymorphism): Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters

class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

Method Overriding (Runtime polymorphism): Redefining a method in a child class that was defined in the parent class

class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

Q: What is abstraction and how can it be implemented? A: Abstraction can be implemented using abstract classes and interfaces:

// Abstract class example
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
    
    // Concrete method
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape");
    }
}

// Interface example
interface Drawable {
    void draw();  // Abstract method
}


Q: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? A:

Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces traditionally only have abstract methods (though Java 8+ allows default methods)

A class can implement multiple interfaces but can extend only one abstract class

Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables, interfaces cannot have constructors and can only have static final variables

Q: How does inheritance promote code reuse? A: Example demonstrating inheritance:

class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numberOfDoors;
    
    // Car inherits startEngine() from Vehicle
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Beep!");
    }
}


Q: What is the importance of the 'super' keyword? A: The 'super' keyword is used to:

Call the parent class constructor

Access parent class methods

Access parent class fields

class Child extends Parent {
    public Child() {
        super(); // Call parent constructor
        super.parentMethod(); // Call parent method
    }
}

These concepts are fundamental to OOP and often come up in technical interviews. Understanding them thoroughly and being able to provide practical examples is crucial for demonstrating your knowledge of object-oriented programming.
