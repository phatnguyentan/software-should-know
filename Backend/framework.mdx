# Framework-specific knowledge (Spring Boot, Django, Express.js, etc.)

## Spring Boot Questions:

Q: What is Spring Boot and how is it different from traditional Spring Framework? 
A: Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that eliminates the boilerplate configurations needed in Spring. Key features include:

Auto-configuration

Standalone applications

Embedded server support

No XML configuration required

Starter dependencies

Q: Explain Spring Boot Actuator 
A: Actuator provides built-in monitoring and management endpoints for Spring Boot applications. It offers features like:

Health checks

Metrics

Environment information

Application state monitoring

## Django Questions:

Q: What is Django and what are its key features? 
A: Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern. Key features include:

Built-in admin interface

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

URL routing

Template engine

Form handling

Authentication system

Q: Explain Django's MTV architecture 
A: Django follows MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture:

Model: Handles database and data logic

Template: Handles presentation logic

View: Acts as a controller, processing user requests and returning responses

## Express.js Questions:

Q: What is Express.js and why use it? A: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides:

Robust routing

Middleware support

Static file serving

Template engine integration

Error handling

Q: Explain Middleware in Express.js 
A: Middleware functions are functions that have access to:

// Example of middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Time:', Date.now());
    next();
});

## General Framework Questions:

Q: How do you handle authentication in your preferred framework? A: Example for Express.js using JWT:

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = process.env.JWT_SECRET;

const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.header('Authorization');
    if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Access denied' });

    try {
        const verified = jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
        req.user = verified;
        next();
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
    }
};


Q: How do you handle database migrations in your framework? 
A: Answers vary by framework:

Spring Boot: Uses tools like Flyway or Liquibase

Django: Built-in migration system using python manage.py migrate

Express.js: Usually uses third-party tools like Sequelize or Knex.js

Q: How do you implement error handling? A: Example in Express.js:

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).json({
        error: 'Something broke!',
        message: err.message
    });
});

Q: How do you implement data validation? 
A: Examples vary by framework:

Spring Boot: Uses annotations like @Valid, @NotNull

Django: Form validation and model validators

Express.js: Uses middleware like express-validator

Q: How do you handle environment configurations? 
A: Best practices include:

Using .env files

Separating development/production configs

Never committing sensitive data to version control

// Express.js example
require('dotenv').config();
const dbConnection = process.env.DATABASE_URL;


Remember to:

Provide specific examples from your experience

Explain your understanding of the framework's architecture

Discuss best practices and security considerations

Be prepared to compare different frameworks

Demonstrate knowledge of common patterns and solutions

These questions cover the fundamentals, but be prepared for more specific questions based on the role and the framework they primarily use.
