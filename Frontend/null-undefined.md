In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are both types of values that represent the absence of a value, but they have distinct meanings and uses. Here’s a breakdown of the differences between them:

### 1. Definition

- **`null`**: 
  - Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is an assignment value that can be explicitly set to indicate "no value" or "no object."
  
- **`undefined`**: 
  - Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.

### 2. Type

- **Type of `null`**: 
  - The type of `null` is an object (this is considered a historical bug in JavaScript).
  ```javascript
  console.log(typeof null); // "object"
  ```

- **Type of `undefined`**: 
  - The type of `undefined` is `undefined`.
  ```javascript
  console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
  ```

### 3. Use Cases

- **When to use `null`**:
  - When you want to explicitly indicate that a variable should have no value.
  - Often used for object references that are expected to be assigned later but are currently empty.

  ```javascript
  let user = null; // user is intentionally set to 'no value'
  ```

- **When to use `undefined`**:
  - When you declare a variable without initializing it.
  - When a function does not return a value explicitly, it returns `undefined`.

  ```javascript
  let count; // count is declared but not initialized, so it's undefined
  function doSomething() {
      // no return statement
  }
  ```

### 4. Equality Comparison

- **Loose Equality (`==`)**:
  - Both `null` and `undefined` are considered equal when using loose equality.
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(null == undefined); // true
  ```

- **Strict Equality (`===`)**:
  - They are not considered equal when using strict equality. This means that `null` is not equal to `undefined` in a strict comparison.
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(null === undefined); // false
  ```

### Summary

- **`null`** is an intentional assignment indicating "no value," while **`undefined`** indicates a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned any value.
- **Types**: `null` is an object; `undefined` is its own type.
- They can be loosely compared but are strictly different.

Understanding these differences is crucial for effective variable management and error handling in JavaScript.
