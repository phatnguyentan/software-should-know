### Software Leadership Interview Topics: Detailed Guide

This guide expands on the provided topics for interviewing candidates for software leadership positions (e.g., Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, or Director of Engineering). I've organized it into the original categories for consistency, but added more details under each subtopic, including key concepts to prepare for, sample interview questions, and best practices or insights drawn from industry standards. These expansions are based on common themes from engineering management interviews, emphasizing behavioral, situational, and technical aspects to assess leadership fit.

Where relevant, I've included sample questions that interviewers might ask or that candidates should prepare to answer, along with tips for responses.
